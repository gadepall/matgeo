\item If any two columns of 
$\Vec{\vec{p}} = \myvec{4 & 7 & 8 \\
                  3 & 1 & 5 \\
                  9 & 6 & 2 }$
are interchanged, which one of the following statements regarding the value of the determinant is CORRECT?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Absolute value remains unchanged but sign will change.  
\item Both absolute value and sign will change.  
\item Absolute value will change but sign will not change.  
\item Both absolute value and sign will remain unchanged.  
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider an ant crawling along the curve $(x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4$, where $x$ and $y$ are in meters. The ant starts at the point $(4, 0)$ and moves counter-clockwise with a speed of 1.57 meters per second. The time taken by the ant to reach the point $(2, 2)$ is (in seconds) \rule{1cm}{0.01pt}.
