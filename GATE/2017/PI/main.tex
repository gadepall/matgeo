\item In a machining operation with turning tool, the tool life ($T$) is related to cutting speed $v$ (m/s), feed $f$ (mm) and depth of cut $d$ (mm) as:  
\begin{align*}
T = C\, v^{-0.25} f^{-0.9} d^{-0.15}
\end{align*}
where $C$ is a constant. The suggested values are $v = 1.5 \ \text{m/s}$, $f = 0.25 \ \text{mm}$ and $d = 3 \ \text{mm}$ for normal rough turning.  
If the operation is performed at twice the cutting speed and other parameters remain unchanged,  
the corresponding percentage change in tool life is:  
..............

\item "If you are looking for a history of India, or for an account of the rise and fall of the British Raj,  
or for the reason of the cleaving of the subcontinent into two mutually antagonistic parts and the effects this mutilation will have in  
the respective sections, and ultimately on Asia, you will not find it in these pages; for though I have spent a lifetime in the country,  
I lived too near the seat of events, and was too intimately associated with the actors, to get the perspective needed for the  
impartial recording of these matters."
