    \item A four-arm uncontrolled un-signalized urban intersection of both way traffic is illustrated in \figref{fig:Img12}. Vehicles approaching the intersection from the directions A, B, C, and D can move to either left, right, or continue in straight direction. No U-turn is allowed. In the given situation, the maximum number of vehicular crossing conflict points for this intersection is \rule{2cm}{0.4pt}. (answer in integer) \\
