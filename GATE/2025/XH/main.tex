 \item Amma's tone in the context of the given passage is that of: 
  For Amma, the difference between men and women was a kind of discrimination and inequality; she felt strongly about women's rights but was not familiar with concepts like gender and patriarchy. She would have dismissed Betty Friedan because she was predominantly dealing with the problems of white middle-class women in the United States. Amma, and women of her generation, could de-link the oppression of women from the wider struggle for the liberation of human beings from class exploitation and imperialism. So Amma continued to play her role as mother and wife, but would often complain: 'I am a doormat on which everyone wipes their emotional dirt off'.

Scientists associate large brains with greater intelligence. However, in the evolutionary context it has also been identified that beyond a point, the size of the brain has not increased and yet after a particular period, in spite of no significant change in brain size humans have made significant progress. Certain researchers propose that this is because, while the overall brain size may not have changed, marked structural changes can be noticed in specific structures that run parallel to increase in human intelligence.

      The purpose of this work is to inform educators about the brain science related to emotion and learning, and, more important, to offer strategies to apply these understandings to their own teaching. Although many of the approaches I describe will be familiar, integrating the tiers of emotion and the brain may be a new concept.
