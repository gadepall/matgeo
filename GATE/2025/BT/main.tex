\item \textit{E. coli} is inoculated in a shake flask containing nutrient rich medium. The initial number of viable cells in the medium is $10^2$. After few hours, the number of viable cells is $10^6$. Assuming cell divides by binary fission, the number of generations that have taken place is \_\_\_\_ (rounded off to the nearest integer).

\item A fermentor is filled with medium at a rate of 1 L min$^{-1}$. A leak develops at the bottom of the fermentor when the medium in the fermentor reaches 200 L. The rate of medium leakage is $2t$ L min$^{-1}$, where $t$ is the time (in minutes) from when the leak begins. The volume of medium in the fermentor after 10 min of leakage is \_\_\_\_\_ L (Answer in integer).

\item A fed batch process is running at quasi-steady state with respect to substrate and biomass concentration. At 2 h, the culture volume is 500 L with a constant sterile inlet feed at 50 L h$^{-1}$ of glucose. The culture kinetic parameters $\mu_m$ and $K_S$ are 0.2 h$^{-1}$ and 0.1 g L$^{-1}$, respectively. The substrate concentration in the reactor will be \_\_\_\_\_ g L$^{-1}$ (rounded off to one decimal place).

\item Consider scale-up of fungal fermentation from a 20 L model-type to 20{,}000 L prototype stirred tank reactor. The model-type and prototype have the same aspect ratio during scale-up. The impeller speed in the model-type is 500 rpm and the scale-up criterion is constant shear. The impeller speed in the prototype reactor will be \_\_\_\_\_ rpm (Answer in integer).
