A researcher catches one fish at random from this population. Given that a male fish is caught, the probability that it is blue is\hfill {(GATE EE 2025)} \rule{4cm}{0.15mm}.

\item Shannon's index of diversity is calculated using the equation below, where $p_i$ is the proportion of the $i^{th}$ species and $\ln$ is natural logarithm. For a community with a given number of species, which of the following statements is true?\hfill {(GATE EE 2025)}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shannon's index will be highest if all species have equal abundance
\item Shannon's index will be highest if one species is highly dominant
\item Shannon's index will be highest if there are many rare species
\item The relative abundance is irrelevant to Shannon's index

\item A team of conservation biologists, surveying a population of frogs on an island, captured and marked 312 individuals in the first sample. In a second sampling, 3 days later, the team caught 140 individuals of which 26 were previously marked. The total number of frogs on the island is estimated to be \rule{4cm}{0.15mm}.\hfill {(GATE EE 2025)}

\item The following equation represents a hypothetical relationship between fitness ($w$) and shoot:root ratio ($r$) in individuals of a plant species: $w = 10r-10r^2$. At what value of shoot:root ratio ($r$), do these plants achieve maximum fitness?

\item The relative abundance of C3 relative to C4 plant species increases with latitude because of the associated temperature gradient. A study in North America found that at 42\degree North, C3 plants become more abundant than C4 plants. Given an increase in mean global temperatures by 10\degree and no other changes in environmental conditions, the latitude at which C3 plants become more abundant:\hfill {(GATE EE 2025)}

\item will move Southwards towards the equator
\item will move South of the equator
\item will not change in response to temperature
