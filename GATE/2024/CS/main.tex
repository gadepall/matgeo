    \item Consider a network path P-Q-R between nodes P and R via router Q. Node P sends a file of size $10^6$ bytes to R via this path by splitting the file into chunks of $10^3$ bytes each. Node P sends these chunks one after the other without any wait time between the successive chunk transmissions. Assume that the size of extra headers added to these chunks is negligible, and that the chunk size is less than the MTU.
    
    Each of the links P-Q and Q-R has a bandwidth of $10^6$ bits/sec, and negligible propagation latency. Router Q immediately transmits every packet it receives from P to R, with negligible processing and queueing delays. Router Q can simultaneously receive on link P-Q and transmit on link Q-R.
    
    Assume P starts transmitting the chunks at time $t=0$.
