\item All the bars in the given truss are elastic with Young’s modulus 200 GPa, and have identical cross-sections with moment of inertia 0.1 cm\(^4\). The lowest value of the load \( P \) at which the truss fails due to buckling is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} kN (round off to the nearest integer).

\item A solid circular shaft is designed to transmit a torque \( T \) with a factor of safety of 2. It is proposed to replace the solid shaft by a hollow shaft of the same material and identical outer radius. If the inner radius is half the outer radius, the factor of safety for the hollow shaft is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} (round off to 1 decimal place).

\item In the structure shown in the figure, bars AB and BC are made of identical material and have circular cross-sections of 10 mm radii. The yield stress of the material under uniaxial tension is 280 MPa. Using the von Mises yield criterion, the maximum load along the z-direction (perpendicular to the plane of paper) that can be applied at C, such that AB does not yield is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} N (round off to the nearest integer).

\item A thin-walled tube, with the cross-section shown in the figure, is subjected to a torque of \( T = 1  \text{kN-m} \). The walls have uniform thickness \( t = 1  \text{mm} \) and shear modulus \( G = 26  \text{GPa} \). Assume that the curved portion is semi-circular. The shear stress in the wall is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} MPa (round off to 1 decimal place).

\item For a damped spring-mass system, mass \( m = 10  \text{kg} \), stiffness \( k = 10^3  \text{N/m} \), and damping coefficient \( c = 20  \text{kg/s} \). The ratio of the amplitude of oscillation of the first cycle to that of the fifth cycle is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} (round off to 1 decimal place).

\item For the system of springs and masses shown below, \( k = 1250  \text{N/m} \) and \( m = 10  \text{kg} \). The highest natural frequency, \( \omega_1 \) of the system is \underline{\hspace{1.5cm}} radians/s (round off to the nearest integer).
