\item Since the last one year, after a 125 basis point reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India, banking institutions have been making a demand to reduce interest rates on small saving schemes. Finally, the government announced yesterday a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes to bring them on par with fixed deposit interest rates.

Which one of the following statements can be inferred from the given passage?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Whenever the Reserve Bank of India reduces the repo rate, the interest rates on small saving schemes are also reduced
    \item Interest rates on small saving schemes are always maintained on par with fixed deposit interest rates
    \item The government sometimes takes into consideration the demands of banking institutions before reducing the interest rates on small saving schemes
    \item A reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes follow only after a reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India

With the institutionalization of music education the term \textit{gharana} became acceptable. \textit{Gharana} originally referred to hereditary musicians from a particular lineage, including disciples and grand disciples.

In an air blast freezing operation, a flat tray of 1.0 m$\times$1.0 m$\times$0.02 m dimensions is used to freeze filled depodded peas. Bulk density and moisture content of peas are 550 kg m$^{-3}$ and 85\% (w.b.), respectively. Latent heat of freezing from water to ice at -1 $^\circ$C is 335 kJ kg$^{-1}$ and heat transfer occurs identically to the top and the bottom surfaces of the tray. Convective film heat transfer coefficient on the heat transfer surfaces of the tray is 30 W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ and the thermal conductivity of frozen peas is 0.54 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Assuming the tray to be a semi-infinite slab, the freezing time (in minutes) to completely freeze the product (rounded off to one decimal place) is \underline{\hspace{2cm}}.
