 \item Since the last one year, after a 125 basis point reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India, banking institutions have been making a demand to reduce interest rates on small saving schemes. Finally, the government announced yesterday a reduction in interest rates on small saving schemes to bring them on par with fixed deposit interest rates.\\

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Whenever the Reserve Bank of India reduces the repo rate, the interest rates on small saving schemes are also reduced
