\item 
In a tractor rear axle differential, the bevel pinion has 12 teeth and bevel/crown gear has 42 teeth. The input speed and torque of the bevel pinion are 520 rpm and 1200 N m, respectively. There is a planetary gear between the differential unit and each half axle with 4:1 speed reduction. The left wheel encounters poor traction when the tractor is moving in straight path that causes 15\% drop in the left axle torque. If the differential efficiency is 0.98, the right axle torque under locked differential condition in N m will be \dots.
