        P) Weber’s law & i) The detection of change in a stimulus is relative to the magnitude of the stimulus \\
        Q) Steven’s Power law & ii) Sensory magnitude grows in proportion to the physical intensity of the stimulus raised to a power \\
        R) Signal detection theory & iii) The magnitude of a sensation is a logarithmic function of the stimulus \\
        S) Fechner’s law & iv) The ability to detect a weak stimulus varies from moment to moment as per response bias \\
