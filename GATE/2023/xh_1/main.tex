\item Which one of the options does NOT describe the passage below or follow from it? 
 We tend to think of cancer as a ‘modern’ illness because its metaphors are so modern. It is a disease of overproduction, of sudden growth, a growth that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. Modern cell biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that machine unable to quench its initial command (to grow) and thus transform into an indestructible, self-propelled automaton.\\
\sbrak{Adapted from \textit{The Emperor of All Maladies} by Siddhartha Mukherjee}
\begin{enumerate}
\item   It is a reflection of why cancer seems so modern to most of us. 
\item   It tells us that modern cell biology uses and promotes metaphors of machinery. 
\item   Modern cell biology encourages metaphors of machinery, and cancer is often imagined as a machine. 
\item   Modern cell biology never uses figurative language, such as metaphors, to describe or explain anything.

\item  Most obviously, mobility is taken to be a geographical as well as a social phenomenon.
\item  Much of the social mobility literature regarded society as a uniform surface and failed to register the geographical intersections of region, city and place, with the social categories of class, gender and ethnicity.
\item  The existing sociology of migration is incidentally far too limited in its concerns to be very useful here.
\item  Further, I am concerned with the flows of people within, but especially beyond, the territory of each society, and how these flows may relate to many different desires, for work, housing, leisure, religion, family relationships, criminal gain, asylum seeking and so on.
\item  Moreover, not only people are mobile but so too are many ‘objects’.
\item  I show that sociology’s recent development of a ‘sociology of objects’ needs to be taken further and that the diverse flows of objects across societal borders and their intersections with the multiple flows of people are hugely significant.

\item  The stranger is by nature no "owner of soil" -- soil not only in the physical, but also in the figurative sense of a life-substance, which is fixed, if not in a point in space, at least in an ideal point of the social environment. Although in more intimate relations, he may develop all kinds of charm and significance, as long as he is considered a stranger in the eyes of the other, he is not an "owner of soil." 
\newline
Restriction to intermediary trade, and often (as though sublimated from it) to pure finance, gives him the specific character of mobility. If mobility takes place within a closed group, it embodies that synthesis of nearness and distance which constitutes the formal position of the stranger. For, the fundamentally mobile person comes in contact, at one time or another, with every individual, but is not organically connected, through established ties of kinship, locality, and occupation, with any single one.
\vspace{1mm}
What assumptions can be made about the stranger from the passage above? \\
\begin{enumerate} 
\item   The stranger can become an owner of soil through developing all kinds of charm in more intimate relations. 
\item   The stranger cannot become an owner of soil either in the physical or psychological sense. 
\item   The stranger can become an owner of soil through establishing ties of kinship and so on.
\item   The stranger might become an owner of soil in the physical sense but not in the psychological.
