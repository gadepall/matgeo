\label{tab:tables/table5.tex}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\textbf{Regime} & \textbf{Statements} \\ \hline
P. Rubbery regime & 1. Stress-relaxation takes place and the excess free energy is dissipated \\
Q. Region around glass transition temperature (Tg) & 2. The motions of the molecules are long-range \\
R. Sample under deformed state & 3. Segmental motion of the molecules is important \\
 & 4. The maximum relaxation time is strongly dependent on the molecular weight \\
 & 5. The deformations are independent of the molecular weight and primarily depend on the local structure \\
