  \item   The information contained in DNA is used to synthesize proteins that are necessary
for the functioning of life. DNA is composed of four nucleotides: Adenine (A),Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). The information contained in DNA can then be thought of as a sequence of these four nucleotides: A, T, C, and G. DNA has coding and non-coding regions. Coding regions-where the sequence of these nucleotides are read in groups of three to produce individual amino acids-constitute only about 2\% of human DNA. For example, the triplet of nucleotides CCG codes for the amino acid glycine, while the triplet GGA codes for
the amino acid proline. Multiple amino acids are then assembled to form a protein.\\
Based only on the information provided above, which of the following statements
can be logically inferred with certainty?\\
(i)The majority of human DNA has no role in the synthesis of proteins.
(ii)The function of about 98\% of human DNA is not understood.
