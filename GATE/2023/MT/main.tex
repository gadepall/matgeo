 \item Amma's tone in the context of the given passage is that of:

    \medskip
     
    For Amma, the difference between men and women was a kind of discrimination and inequality; she felt strongly about women's rights but was not familiar with concepts like gender and patriarchy. She would have dismissed Betty Friedan because she was predominantly dealing with the problems of white middle-class women in the United States. Amma, and women of her generation, could de-link the oppression of women from the wider struggle for the liberation of human beings from class exploitation and imperialism. So Amma continued to play her role as mother and wife, but would often complain: 'I am a doormat on which everyone wipes their emotional dirt off'.

\item Which of the statement(s) about the passage weaken(s) the argument presented?\\

Scientists associate large brains with greater intelligence. However, in the evolutionary context it has also been identified that beyond a point, the size of the brain has not increased and yet after a particular period, in spite of no significant change in brain size humans have made significant progress. Certain researchers propose that this is because, while the overall brain size may not have changed, marked structural changes can be noticed in specific structures that run parallel to increase in human intelligence.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Recent studies refute the hypothesis that region-specific brain development is necessarily associated with rapid human progress
    \item Neanderthal people's extinction was probably because of their brain size
    \item Homo Sapiens and its destruction in the future may happen because of its rapid brain development
    \item Recent studies show that Neanderthal people, with relatively smaller brains, were capable of complex language and social activities
\end{enumerate}

\item The narrator's use of 'I' in the given passage is/are:

I have never been any good at the more lurid sort of writing. Psychopathic killers, impotent war-heroes, self-tortured film stars, and seedy espionage agents must exist in the world, but strangely enough I do not come across them, and I prefer to write about the people and places I have known and the lives of those whose paths I have crossed. This crossing of paths makes for stories rather than novels, and although I have worked in both mediums, I am happier being a short-story writer than a novelist.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Self-conscious
    \item Apologetic and regretful
    \item Confessional and communicating
    \item Egotistical and vain

  Stated problem: Many students at educational institutes do not attend classes in the post-pandemic scenario.

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item Disciplinary action against all students should be taken as a warning.
    \item Counselling sessions should be organized to address the issues such students face.
    \item Surveys should be conducted to identify the reasons for their absence.
    \item Course content should immediately be changed.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Read the passage and identify the statement(s) which follow(s) from it:

  The purpose of this work is to inform educators about the brain science related to emotion and learning, and, more important, to offer strategies to apply these understandings to their own teaching. Although many of the approaches I describe will be familiar, integrating the lens of emotion and the brain may be a new concept. As an educator I had been trained in how to deliver content and organize my lessons, but I had not been taught how to design learning experiences that support emotions for learning.

    \item The author wishes, through his work, to inform us about brain science and learning.
    \item The author, through his work, wishes to offer strategies to apply our learnings to our teaching.
    \item The author feels that the newness of his approach lies in linking emotion oriented approach to brain.
    \item The author wants to use emotions as a strategy for learning.
