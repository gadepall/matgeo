\item Which one of the options does NOT describe the passage below or follow from it? 
We tend to think of cancer as a ‘modern’ illness because its metaphors are
so modern. It is a disease of overproduction, of sudden growth, a growth
that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. Modern cell biology
encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that
machine unable to quench its intial command (to grow) and thus transform
into an indestructible, self-propelled automaton. 
\sbrak{Adapted from The Emperor of All Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is a reflection of why cancer seems so modern to most of us. 
\item It tells us that modern cell biology uses and promotes metaphors of machinery. 
\item Modern cell biology encourages metaphors of machinery, and cancer is often
imagined as a machine. 
\item Modern cell biology never uses figurative language, such as metaphors, to describe
or explain anything.

\item[1.] Most obviously, mobility is taken to be a geographical as well as a social
phenomenon. 
\item[2.] Much of the social mobility literature regarded society as a uniform surface and
failed to register the geographical intersections of region, city and place, with
the social categories of class, gender and ethnicity. 
\item[3.] The existing sociology of migration is incidentally far too limited in its concerns
to be very useful here. 
\item[4.] Further, I am concerned with the flows of people within, but especially beyond,
the territory of each society, and how these flows may relate to many different
desires, for work, housing, leisure, religion, family relationships, criminal gain,
asylum seeking and so on. 
\item[5.] Moreover, not only people are mobile but so too are many 'objects'. 
\item[6.] I show that sociology’s recent development of a 'sociology of objects' needs to
be taken further and that the diverse flows of objects across societal borders and
their intersections with the multiple flows of people are hugely significant.

%Q.21
\item The stranger is by nature no ""owner of soil"" -- soil not only in the physical, but also
in the figurative sense of a life-substance, which is fixed, if not in a point in space,
at least in an ideal point of the social environment. Although in more intimate
relations, he may develop all kinds of charm and significance, as long as he is
considered a stranger in the eyes of the other, he is not an ""owner of soil.""
Restriction to intermediary trade, and often (as though sublimated from it) to pure
finance, gives him the specific character of mobility. If mobility takes place within
a closed group, it embodies that synthesis of nearness and distance which constitutes
the formal position of the stranger. For, the fundamentally mobile person comes in
contact, at one time or another, with every individual, but is not organically
connected, through established ties of kinship, locality, and occupation, with any
single one. 
What assumptions can be made about the stranger from the passage above? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The stranger can become an owner of soil through developing all kinds of charm in
more intimate relations. 
\item The stranger cannot become an owner of soil either in the physical or psychological
sense. 
\item The stranger can become an owner of soil through establishing ties of kinship and
so on. 
\item The stranger might become an owner of soil in the physical sense but not in the
psychological

own special kind. It selects, eliminates, alters, exaggerates, minimizes, glorifies, and

\item Truth is what can be verified by hard empirical evidence.
