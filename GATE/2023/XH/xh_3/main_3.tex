\item Which one of the options does NOT describe the passage below or follow from it?
We tend to think of cancer as a ‘modern’ illness because its metaphors are so modern. It is a disease of overproduction, of sudden growth, a growth that is unstoppable, tipped into the abyss of no control. Modern cell biology encourages us to imagine the cell as a molecular machine. Cancer is that machine unable to quench its initial command (to grow) and thus transform into an indestructible, self-propelled automaton.\\
\sbrak{Adapted from \textit{The Emperor of All Maladies} by Siddhartha Mukherjee}
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is a reflection of why cancer seems so modern to most of us.
\item It tells us that modern cell biology uses and promotes metaphors of machinery.
\item Modern cell biology encourages metaphors of machinery, and cancer is often imagined as a machine.
\item Modern cell biology never uses figurative language, such as metaphors, to describe or explain anything.

\item[1.] Most obviously, mobility is taken to be a geographical as well as a social phenomenon.
\item[2.] Much of the social mobility literature regarded society as a uniform surface and failed to register the geographical intersections of region, city and place, with the social categories of class, gender and ethnicity.
\item[3.] The existing sociology of migration is incidentally far too limited in its concerns to be very useful here.
\item[4.] Further, I am concerned with the flows of people within, but especially beyond, the territory of each society, and how these flows may relate to many different desires, for work, housing, leisure, religion, family relationships, criminal gain, asylum seeking and so on.
\item[5.] Moreover, not only people are mobile but so too are many ‘objects’.
\item[6.] I show that sociology’s recent development of a ‘sociology of objects’ needs to be taken further and that the diverse flows of objects across societal borders and their intersections with the multiple flows of people are hugely significant.

\item The stranger is by nature no "owner of soil" -- soil not only in the physical, but also in the figurative sense of a life-substance, which is fixed, if not in a point in space, at least in an ideal point of the social environment. Although in more intimate relations, he may develop all kinds of charm and significance, as long as he is considered a stranger in the eyes of the other, he is not an "owner of soil." Restriction to intermediary trade, and often (as though sublimated from it) to pure finance, gives him the specific character of mobility. If mobility takes place within a closed group, it embodies that synthesis of nearness and distance which constitutes the formal position of the stranger. For, the fundamentally mobile person comes in contact, at one time or another, with every individual, but is not organically connected, through established ties of kinship, locality, and occupation, with any single one.
What assumptions can be made about the stranger from the passage above?
\begin{enumerate} 
\item The stranger can become an owner of soil through developing all kinds of charm in more intimate relations.
\item The stranger cannot become an owner of soil either in the physical or psychological sense.
\item The stranger can become an owner of soil through establishing ties of kinship and so on.
\item The stranger might become an owner of soil in the physical sense but not in the psychological.

\item “I told you the truth,” I say yet again, “Memory’s truth, because memory has its own special kind. It selects, eliminates, alters, exaggerates, minimizes, glorifies, and vilifies also; but in the end it creates its own reality, its heterogeneous but usually coherent versions of events; and no sane human being ever trusts someone else’s version more than his own.” What are the different ways in which ‘truth’ can be understood from the passage?
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Truth is what can be verified by hard empirical evidence. 
\item Truth is based on what can be perceived by the senses. 
\item Truth is the product of memory that is fallible, selective and slanted.
