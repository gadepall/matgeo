\textbf{Read the following instructions carefully}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item This question paper contains \textbf{24} printed pages including pages for rough work. Please check all pages and report discrepancy, if any.
    \item Write your registration number, your name and name of the examination centre at the specified locations on the right half of the ORS.
    \item Using HB pencil, darken the appropriate bubble under each digit of your registration number and the letters corresponding to your paper code.
    \item All the questions in this question paper are of objective type.
    \item Questions must be answered on \textbf{O}bjective \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}heet (\textbf{ORS}) by darkening the appropriate bubble (marked A, B, C, D) using HB pencil against the question number on the left hand side of the ORS. \textbf{Each question has only one correct answer}. In case you wish to change an answer, erase the old answer completely. More than one answer bubbled against a question will be treated as a wrong answer.
    \item Questions 1 through 20 are 1-mark questions and questions 21 through 85 are 2-mark questions.
    \item Questions 71 through 73 is one set of common data questions. The question pairs (76, 77), (78, 79), (80, 81), (82, 83) and (84, 85) are questions with linked answers. The answer to the second question of the above pairs will depend on the answer to the first question of the pair. If the first question in the linked pair is wrongly answered or is un-attempted, then the answer to the second question will not be evaluated.
    \item Unattempted questions will carry zero marks.
    \item \textbf{NEGATIVE MARKING}: For Q.1 to Q.20, \textit{\textbf{0.25}} mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For Q.21 to Q.75, \textit{\textbf{0.5}} mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For the pairs of questions with linked answers, there will be negative marks only for wrong answer to the first question, i.e. for Q.76, Q.78, Q.80, Q.82 and Q.84, \textit{\textbf{0.5}} mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. There is no negative marking for Q.77, Q.79, Q.81, Q.83 and Q.85.
    \item Calculator \textbf{without data connectivity} is allowed in the examination hall.
    \item Charts, graph sheets and tables are NOT allowed in the examination hall.
    \item Rough work can be done on the question paper itself. Additional blank pages are given at the end of the question paper for rough work.

In the figure shown, the system is a pure substance kept in a piston-cylinder arrangement. The system is initially a two-phase mixture containing 1 kg of liquid and 0.03 kg of vapour at a pressure of 100 kPa. Initially, the pison rests on a set of stops, as shown in the figure. A pressure of 200 kPa is required to exactly balance the weight of the piston and the outside atmospheric pressure. Heat transfer takes place into the system until its volume increases by 50\%. Heat transfer to the system occurs in such a manner that the piston, when allowed to move, does so in a very slow (quasi-static / quasi-equilibrium) process. The thermal reservoir from which heat is transferred to the system has a temperature of 400$^\circ$C. Average temperature of the system boundary can be taken as 175$^\circ$C. The heat transfer to the system is 1 kJ, during which its entrpoy increases by 10 J/K.

A cylindrical container of radius R = 1 m, wall thickness 1 mm is filled with water up to a deth of 2 m and suspended along its upper rim. The density of water is 1000 kg/m$^3$ and acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s$^2$. The self-weight of the cylinder is negligible. The formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder can be used at all points along the height of the cylindrical container.

In the feed drive of a Point-to-Point open loop CNC drive, a stepper motor rotating at 200 steps/rev drives a table through a gear box and lead screw-nut mechanism (pitch = 4 mm, number of starts = 1). The gear ratio ($=\frac{\text{Output rotational speed}}{\text{Input rotational speed}}$) is given by $U=\frac{1}{4}$. The stepper motor (driven by voltage pulses from a pulse generator) executes 1 step/pulse of the pulse generator. The frequency of the pulse train from the pulse generator is $f=10,000$ pulses per minute.
