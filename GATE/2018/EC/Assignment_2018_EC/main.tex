\item The Cricket Board has long recognized John's potential as a leader of the team. However, his on-field temper has always been a matter of concern for them since his junior days. While this aggression has filled stadia with die-hard fans, it has taken a toll on his own batting. Until recently, it appeared that he found it difficult to convert his aggression into big scores. Over the past three seasons though, that picture of John has been replaced by a cerebral, calculative and successful batsman-captain. After many years, it appears that the team has finally found a complete captain.

Which of the following statements can be logically inferred from the above paragraph?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] Even as a junior cricketer, John was considered a good captain.
\item[(ii)] Finding a complete captain is a challenge.
\item[(iii)] Fans and the Cricket Board have differing views on what they want in a captain.

\item A coastal region with unparalleled beauty is home to many species of animals. It is dotted with coral reefs and unspoilt white sandy beaches. It has remained inaccessible to tourists due to poor connectivity and lack of accommodation.

\item The culture and tradition of the local people will be influenced by the tourists.
\item The region will become crowded and polluted due to tourism.
