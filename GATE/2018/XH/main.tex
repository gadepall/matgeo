   \item Consider the following system of equations in three variables $x, y, z$
  \begin{align*}
    -x - y - z &= 3 \\
    x + y + z &= 10 \\
    2x - 3y &= 6
  \end{align*}
  This system of equations has

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item no combination of values of $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this system simultaneously
    \item only one combination of values of $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this system simultaneously
    \item only two combinations of values of $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this system simultaneously
    \item infinitely many combinations of values of $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this system simultaneously
  \end{enumerate}
