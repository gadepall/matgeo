\item The Arecibo telescope does not resemble what most of us think of when we hear
the word telescope. Its reflective surface covers an area of 20 acres, which is quite
remarkable. Dangling above it are towers and cables, sub-reflectors and antennas,
all of which can be positioned using 26 motors to transmit radio waves and receive
echoes with astonishing precision.

 \item Tailgating another vehicle is unsafe and illegal. Many rear-end collisions are caused by drivers following too close to the vehicle in front of them. The rules state that a driver must keep significant distance from the vehicle in front in order to stop safely and avoid a collision. Drivers should allow a minimum two seconds gap between their vehicle and the one ahead. At 60 km per hour, this equates to a gap of 33 meters; at 100 km per hour, it equates to a gap of 55 meters. More distance is needed to safely stop in rain or poor visibility, as during rain slippery roads reduce the effectiveness of braking.\\

    Which of the following statement(s) \textbf{can be inferred} from the above passage?

  
    

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item People drive faster in rain and under poor visibility.
        \item Braking may not be as effective during rain as in the dry conditions.
        \item Tailgating is against the road rules.
        \item Collision has no relationship with tailgating.

 \item For a painting to succeed, it is essential that the painter and his public agree about what is significant. The subject of the painting may have a personal meaning for the painter or a common person; but there can also be the possibility of their agreement on its general meaning. It is at this point that the culture of the society and the period in question precedes the artists and her/his art. Renaissance art would have meant nothing to the Aztecs, and vice versa. If, to some extent, a few intellectuals can appreciate them both today, it is because their culture is a historical one. Its inspiration is history and all known developments to date.

According to the passage, which of the following is/are \textbf{NOT necessarily} among the attributes needed for a painter to succeed?

\item Cholera, typhoid, diphtheria and tuberculosis cause huge number of deaths.Poor quality drinking water has always been the world's greatest single carrier of sickness. Disease is transmitted when sewage and drinking water come into contact.Children are particularly vulnerable. In some of the poorest countries the infant mortality rate is high. The separation of sewage and the supply of clean drinking water are the domain of civil engineers, and their work makes a significant contribution to public health. That contribution was recognized when public sanitation was voted the greatest medical breakthrough, beating the discoveries including antibiotics and vaccines in a poll organized by the British Medical Journal.

 \item Shark's teeth have evolved to correspond to the diet of each particular species of shark. Consequently, the teeth of the great white shark bear little resemblance to those of the bull shark or nurse shark. There were essentially four different shark diets and thus four varieties of shark teeth. Sharks that feed on fish have needle like teeth, perfect for spearing and ripping. Sharks that eat mammals such as seals and sea lions have heavy, serrated teeth, typically triangular on the upper jaw and pointed on the lower jaw. Shark that feed in the benthic zone of the ocean have flattened teeth for crushing the shell of the creatures they find scuttling in the sand or clinging to rocks. Sharks that bask have teeth that are largely non-functional; these sharks filter food from the water by passing it through their gills.

Which of the following is/are the \textbf{CORRECT inference(s)} as per the passage?
