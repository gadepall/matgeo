The filter was mounted in the sampler and the initial air flow rate through the filter was set at $1.5~m^3/min$. Sampling continued for 24 hours. The airflow after 24 hours was measured to be $1.4~m^3/min$. The dry weight of the filter paper after 24 hours sampling was $10.283~g$. Assuming a linear decline in the air flow rate during sampling, what is the 24 hour average TSP concentration in ambient air?
