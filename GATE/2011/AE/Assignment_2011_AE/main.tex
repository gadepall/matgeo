\textbf{Read the following instructions carefully}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Questions must be answered using computers provided by the GATE at the examination centers. Each computer shall run specialized examination software that permits a maximum of one answer to be selected for questions of multiple choice type.    
    \item Your answers shall be updated and saved on the server periodically and at the end of the examination. The examination will automatically stop once the duration of the examination is over.
    \item There are a total of \textbf{65} questions carrying 100 marks. All questions are of objective type.    
    \item Questions Q.1 – Q.25 carry 1-mark each, and questions Q.26 – Q.55 carry 2-marks each.    
    \item Questions Q.26 - Q.30 are of numerical answer type. For each of these questions, the correct answer is a number. All other questions are of multiple choice type. Each of these questions carries four choices for the answer labeled A, B, C and D. Only one of the four choices is the correct answer.    
    \item Questions Q.48 – Q.51 (2 pairs) are common data questions and question pairs (Q.52, Q.53) and (Q.54, Q.55) are linked answer questions. The answer to the second question of the linked answer questions depends on the answer to the first question of the pair. If the first question in the linked pair is wrongly answered or is unattempted, then the answer to the second question in the pair will not be evaluated.    
    \item Questions Q.56 – Q.65 belong to General Aptitude (GA). Questions Q.56 – Q.60 carry 1-mark each, and questions Q.61 – Q.65 carry 2-marks each.    
    \item Unattempted questions will result in zero mark. There is no negative marking for questions of numerical answer type, i.e., for Q.26 – Q.30. For questions of multiple choice type, wrong answers will result in \textbf{NEGATIVE} marks. For Q.1 – Q.25 and Q.56 – Q.60, $\frac{1}{3}$ mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. For Q.31 – Q.51 and Q.61 – Q.65, $\frac{2}{3}$ mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. The question pairs (Q.52, Q.53), and (Q.54, Q.55) are questions with linked answers. There will be negative marks only for wrong answer to the first question of the linked answer question pair, i.e. for Q.52 and Q.54, $\frac{2}{3}$ mark will be deducted for each wrong answer. There is no negative marking for Q.53 and Q.55.    
    \item Calculator is allowed whereas charts, graph sheets or tables are \textbf{NOT} allowed in the examination hall.    
    \item Rough work can be done in the specified area only.

    \item In order to answer a question, you may select the question using the left side selection panel on the screen and choose the correct answer by clicking on the radio button next to the answer. The answered questions shall be indicated by a solid black ball on the selection panel. In order to change the answer, you may just click on another option. If you wish to leave a previously answered question unanswered, you may click on DESELECT ANSWER button.    
    \item You may also select questions using NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons.    
    \item You may also mark questions for reviewing later using MARK button. All marked questions are indicated by a rectangle in the selection panel. Questions which are answered but are marked for the review are indicated by a solid black rectangle and questions which are not answered but are marked for the review are indicated by an outlined rectangle in the selection panel.
