\item Identify the {CORRECT} statements for a $n\times n$ matrix.
\hfill{(PE 2021)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Under elementary row operations, the rank of the matrix remains invariant
    \item Under elementary row operations, the eigenvalues of the matrix remain the same
    \item  If the elements in a row can be written as a linear combination of two or more rows, then the matrix is singular.
    \item The rank of the matrix is equal to $n$ if the determinant of the matrix is zero
\end{enumerate}
\item Given matrix $\vec{A}=\myvec{
2&-1\\
-1&2}$. The eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector $\myvec{1\\
-1}$ is \dots
