Blood tests are often used to screen for potential diseases. For a particular disease:\\
(i) Of 1000 persons who tested negative ($T'$), 1 person had the disease ($D$); $Pr(D|T').$\\
(ii) Of 10 persons who tested positive ($T$), 1 person had the disease ($D$); $Pr(D|T)$.\\
From this we can calculate\\\newline
$\displaystyle \frac{Pr(D|T)}{Pr(D|T')} = \frac{1/10}{1/1000} = 100$\\
What can be inferred from this value? \hfill {(GATE EY 2020)}

\item People with positive tests are 100 times more likely to have the disease than people with negative tests.
