\item Tangents are drawn from point $\brak{17 , 7}$ to the circle $x^2+y^2=169$.\\
STATEMENT-$1$:The tangents are mutually perpendicular.because\\
STATEMENT-$2$:The locus of all points from which mutually perpendicular tangents can be drawn to a given circle is $x^2+y^2=338$. \hfill(2007-3M)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Statement-$1$ is True,statement-$2$ is True;Statement-$2$ is a correct explantion for Statement-$1$.
\item Statement-$1$ is True,statement-$2$ is True;Statement-$2$ is NOT a correct explantion for Statement-$1$.
\item Statement-$1$ is True,Statement-$2$ is False
\item Statement-$1$ is False,Statement-$2$ is True.
\end{enumerate}

\item Consider $L_1:2x+3y+p-3=0$\\
               $L_2:2x+3y+p+3=0$\\
where $p$ is a real number,and C: $x^2+y^2+6x-10y+30=0$\\
STATEMENT-$1$:If line $L_1$ is a chord of circle C ,then line $L_2$ is not always a diameter of circle C\\
and\\
STATEMENT-$2$:If line $L_1$ is a diameter of circle C ,then line $L_2$ is not a chord  of circle C. \hfill(2008)\\
\begin{enumerate}

\item Statement-$1$ is True,Statement-$2$ is False
\item Statement-$1$ is False,Statement-$2$ is True.
