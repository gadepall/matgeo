    \item Suppose that the normals drawn at three different points on the parabola $y^2=4x$ pass through the point$(h,k)$. Show that $h>2$. 
		\hfill(1981-4 Marks)
		
	\item $\vec{A}$ is a point on the parabola $y^2=4ax$. The normal at $\vec{A}$ cuts the parabola again at point $\vec{B}$. If $AB$ subtends a right angle at the vertex of the parabola. Find the slope of $AB$.  
		\hfill(1982-4 Marks)
		
	\item Three normals are drawn from the point $(c,0)$ to the curve $y^2=x$. Show that $c$ must be greater than $\frac{1}{2}$. One normal is always the x-axis. Find $c$ for which the other two normals are perpendicular to each other.

      \item Through the vertex $\vec{O}$ of parabola $y^2=4x$, chords $OP$ and $OQ$ are drawn at right angles to one another. Show that for all positions of $\vec{P}$, $PQ$ cuts the axis of the parabola at a fixed point. Also find the locus of the middle point of $PQ$.

      \item Show that the locus of a point that divides a chord of slope $2$ of the parabola $y^2=4x$ internally in the ratio $1:2$ is a parabola. Find the vertex of this parabola.
