\item Janaki and Jivanti together have $45$ marbles. Both of them lost $5$ marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they have is $124$. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
\item A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be $55$ minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was \rupee750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
\item Find two numbers whose sum is $27$ and product is $182$.
\item Find two consecutive  positive integers, sum of whose squares is $365$.
\item  The altitude of a right triangle is 7 cm less than its base. If the hypotenuse is 13 cm, find the other two sides.
\item A cottage industry produces a certain number of pottery articles in a day. It was observed on a particular day that the cost of production of each article (in rupees) was $3$ more than twice the number of articles produced on that day. If the total cost of production on that day was \rupee90, find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article.

\item Two water taps together can fill a tank in $9\frac{3}{8}$ hours. The tap of larger diameter takes $10$ hours. The tap of larger diameter takes $10$ hours less than the smaller one to fill the tank seperately. Find the time in which each tap can seperately fill the  tank.
\item An express train takes $1$ hour less than a passenger train to travel 132 km between Mysuru and Bengaluru (without taking into consideration the time they stop at intermediate statioons). If the average speed of the express train is 11 km/h more than that of the passenger train, find the average speed of the two trains.
\item Sum of the areas of two squares is $468m^2$. If the difference of their perimeter is 24m, find the sides of the two squares.

\item A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of diameter $1.3$ metres in such a way that the difference of its distances from two diametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is $7$ metres. Is it possible to do so? If yes, at what distances from the two gatees should the pole be erected?
\item The area of a rectangle plot is $528 m^2$. The length of the plot (in metres) is one more than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot.
\item Find two consecutive odd positive integers, sum of whose squares is $290$.
\item A rectangular park is to be designed whose breadth is $3$ m less than its length. Its area is to be $4$ square metres than the area of a park that has already been made in the shape of a isoceles triangle with its base as  the breadth of the rectangular park and of altitude $12$ m. Find its length and breadth.
